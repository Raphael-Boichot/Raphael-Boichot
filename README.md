### What you will find here
These repositories contain unpublished supporting informations, codes and raw data from some of my scientific papers, scientific databases deserving a public release, some dismissed teaching supports and a [bunch of random projects](https://github.com/Raphael-Boichot/Awesome-Game-Boy-Camera-and-Game-Boy-Printer-projects) around programming, documenting nerdy stuff, reverse engineering and electronics made on my spare time.
