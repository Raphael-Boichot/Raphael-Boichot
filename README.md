### What you will find here
These repositories contain unpublished supporting informations, codes and raw data from some of my old scientific papers, scientific databases deserving a public release, some dismissed teaching supports and a bunch of random projects around programming, documenting nerdy stuff, reverse engineering and electronics made on my spare time.

I publish lot of codes in Matlab because it is generally the straightest way of solving scientific problems (and I can afford the licence at work for the moment). I try my best to propose [GNU Octave](https://octave.org/) versions for projects non related to my scientific activity.

My repos generally come with a long writeup because I'm convinced that good stories make good projects. **All tinkerings presented here are open-source, working (tested), finished and documented.**
