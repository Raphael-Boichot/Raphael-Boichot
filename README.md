### What you will find here
These repositories contain unpublished supporting informations, codes and raw data from some of my old scientific papers, scientific databases deserving a public release, some dismissed teaching supports and a bunch of random projects around programming, documenting nerdy stuff, reverse engineering and electronics made on my spare time.

I publish lot of Matlab scripts because this is generally the straightest way of solving engineering problems. I try my best to propose [GNU Octave](https://octave.org/) versions for scripts non related to my scientific activity.

My repos generally come with a long writeup because I'm convinced that good stories make interesting projects. **All tinkerings presented here are open-source, working (tested), finished, documented and maintained (if not archived).**
