### What you will find here
These repositories contain unpublished supporting informations, codes and raw data from some of my old scientific papers, scientific databases deserving a public release, some dismissed teaching supports and a bunch of random projects around programming, documenting nerdy stuff, reverse engineering and electronics made on my spare time.
