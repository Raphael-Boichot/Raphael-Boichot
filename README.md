### What you will find here
These repositories contain unpublished supporting informations, codes and raw data from some of my scientific papers, scientific databases deserving a public release, some dismissed teaching supports and a bunch of random projects around programming, documenting, reverse engineering and electronics made on my spare time.

### What you won't find here
My research articles and data are hosted in [HAL Open Science](https://hal.science/search/index?q=raphael+boichot), [Gitlab](https://ttk.gricad-gitlab.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/boichotr) end [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/6104937#.YhOpROjMLct) and my ongoing lectures given at [Universit√© Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/english/) are not meant to be free and open access, except for one lecture hosted by the [GATE association](https://www.transitionengineering.org/transition_engineering/) for the good of mankind.

**I'm not on any social media for many good reasons. Only way to get in touch with me for non-professional subjects is my gmail.**
