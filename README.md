### What you will find here
These repositories contain supporting informations and raw data from some of my scientific papers, unpublished codes and databases deserving a public release, some dismissed teaching supports and a bunch of random projects around programming, reverse engineering and electronics made on my spare time.

### What you won't find here
My research articles and data are hosted in [HAL Open Science](https://hal.science/search/index?q=raphael+boichot), [Gitlab](https://ttk.gricad-gitlab.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/boichotr) end [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/6104937#.YhOpROjMLct) and my ongoing lectures at University are not meant to be freely open to public at the moment.
