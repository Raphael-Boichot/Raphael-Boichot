### What you will find here
These repositories contain unpublished supporting informations, codes and raw data from some of my old scientific papers, scientific databases deserving a public release, some dismissed teaching supports and a bunch of random projects around programming, documenting nerdy stuff, reverse engineering and electronics made on my spare time.

All of the courses I teach at University Grenoble Alpes as assistant professor can be found in [this repository](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o67P6a5cGjG6utEkP_o-1f_ajaqBZ-Lp?usp=sharing).
