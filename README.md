### What you will find here
These repositories contain unpublished supporting informations, codes and raw data from some of my old scientific papers, scientific databases deserving a public release, some dismissed teaching supports and a bunch of random projects around programming, documenting nerdy stuff, reverse engineering and electronics made on my spare time.

I publish lot of codes in Matlab because it is generally the straightest way of solving scientific problems and try my best to propose GNU Octave versions when I'm not too lazy.
